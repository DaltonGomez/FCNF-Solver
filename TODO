# TODO:

HIGH-PRIORITY CHANGES & BUGS:
=============================
+ REORGANIZE CODEBASE
+ Do not worry about the single capacity per edge constraint- it is implied if the capacity vs. cost is convex
+ Update the GA to allow for multiple possible capacities (i.e. parallel edges)
+ Add method for using NetworkX to randomly generate a network and then parse that into the FCNF class



LOW PRIORITY CHANGES & QUALITY OF LIFE:
=======================================
+ Continue debugging how to get the optimal alpha values
+ Change the loadFromDisc method to recast data to integers on load


POSSIBLE CHANGES & IDEAS:
==================
+ Create a new class for the solution
    - Is this necessary?
+ Modify so that the FCNF instance is of edge values only (i.e. create a super-source/sink and push all source/sink cost onto the edges from the super-source/sink)
    - Not only would this drastically change the network, node, edge, and solver classes, it would also lead to hard to interpret visualization
