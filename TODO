# TODO:

HIGH-PRIORITY CHANGES & BUGS:
=============================
+ Update the GA to allow for multiple possible capacities (i.e. parallel edges)
    - Cannot correctly allow for parallel edge opportunity in the reduction
+ Update the visualization to better display large networks
+ Implement operators that use pathing



LOW PRIORITY CHANGES & QUALITY OF LIFE:
=======================================
+ Continue debugging how to get the optimal alpha values
+ Change input data (e.g. capacities, fixed costs, variable costs, etc.) to be of type float and not int



POSSIBLE CHANGES & IDEAS:
=========================
+ Modify so that the FCNF instance is of edge values only (i.e. create a super-source/sink and push all source/sink cost onto the edges from the super-source/sink)
    - Not only would this drastically change the network, node, edge, and solver classes, it would also lead to hard to interpret visualization
+ Do not worry about the single capacity per edge constraint- it is implied if the capacity vs. cost is convex
