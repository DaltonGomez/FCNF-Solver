# TODO:

HIGH-PRIORITY CHANGES & BUGS:
=============================
+ Add to solution visualization a way to capture relative edge costs in color
+ Change pathing to be only pathlets and/or all paths
+ Test the speed of relaxed-LP solvers on large instances
+ Implement a (Gaussian?) nudge mutation
+ Experiment with finding optimal alpha values from an exact MILP solution
+ Implement other probability functions for randomly determining alpha values



LOW PRIORITY CHANGES & QUALITY OF LIFE:
=======================================
+ Measure population diversity at genotypic and phenotypic levels
+ Do sensitivity/perturbation analysis on alpha values


POSSIBLE CHANGES & IDEAS:
=========================
+ Do not worry about the single capacity per edge constraint- it is implied if the capacity vs. cost function is convex
