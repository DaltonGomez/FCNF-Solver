# TODO:

+ Modify so that we are calculating the true cost, not the "fake cost" returned by the LP
+ Continue debugging how the optimal alpha values
+ Modify so that the FCNF instance is of edge values only (i.e. create a super-source/sink and push all source/sink cost onto the edges from the super-source/sink)
+ Do not worry about the single capacity per edge constraint
