# TODO:

HIGH-PRIORITY CHANGES & BUGS:
=============================
+ Test wall clock time on solving the MILP
+ Set up tuning experiment and find larger test beds
+ Implement the Dynamic Slope Scaling Procedure from Kim-1999



LOW PRIORITY CHANGES & QUALITY OF LIFE:
=======================================
+ Change input data (e.g. capacities, fixed costs, variable costs, etc.) to be of type float and not int



POSSIBLE CHANGES & IDEAS:
=========================
+ Modify so that the FCNF instance is of edge values only (i.e. create a super-source/sink and push all source/sink cost onto the edges from the super-source/sink)
    - Not only would this drastically change the network, node, edge, and solver classes, it would also lead to hard to interpret visualization
+ Do not worry about the single capacity per edge constraint- it is implied if the capacity vs. cost function is convex
+ Incorporate parallel edges
+ Implement an annealing schedule for the alpha bounds???
+ Implement other probability functions for randomly determining alpha values???
