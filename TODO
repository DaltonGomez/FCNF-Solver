# TODO:

+ Continue debugging how to get the optimal alpha values
+ Modify so that the FCNF instance is of edge values only (i.e. create a super-source/sink and push all source/sink cost onto the edges from the super-source/sink)
+ Do not worry about the single capacity per edge constraint
+ Create a new class for the solution
+ Add method for using NetworkX to randomly generate a network and then parse that into the FCNF class
