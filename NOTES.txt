NOTES:

HIGH-PRIORITY CHANGES & BUGS:
=============================
+ Add to solution visualization a way to capture relative edge costs in color
+ Change pathing to be only pathlets and/or all paths
+ Test the speed of relaxed-LP solvers on large instances
+ Implement a (Gaussian?) nudge mutation
+ Experiment with finding optimal alpha values from an exact MILP solution
+ Implement other probability functions for randomly determining alpha values
+ Implement a termination criteria based on convergence, not just number of episodes/generations


LOW PRIORITY CHANGES & QUALITY OF LIFE:
=======================================
+ Measure population diversity at genotypic and phenotypic levels
+ Do sensitivity/perturbation analysis on alpha values


POSSIBLE CHANGES & IDEAS:
=========================
+ Do not worry about the single capacity per edge constraint- it is implied if the capacity vs. cost function is convex

FROM ACO PROJECT:
# TODOs:
# TODO - Setup experiment class/scripts
# TODO - Tune all hyperparameters
# TODO - Determine the most realistic function/method for creating arc costs
# TODO - Determine the best pheromone deposition equation (e.g. proportional to the amount of flow on the arc, not just if it was opened)
Deposit pheromone based on remaining capacity
# TODO - Determine the best "goodness" of arc calculation
Consider using the G(e) = 1/(cap/(FC + VC))
# TODO - Determine if source/sink arcs should have special pheromone deposition and/or "goodness" of arc calculations
# TODO - Determine the best probability distribution function for edge selection
# TODO - Adapt to account for parallel arcs (i.e. more than one possible edge capacity)
# TODO - Implement some post-processing to cancel opposing flows

# FUTURE WORK IDEAS:
* Use the dynamic nature of ACO for optimal sink location within a feasible geologic region (i.e. polygon)
* Use the dynamic nature of ACO for sink capacity uncertainty
* Integrate with a local search technique, such as the alpha-relaxed GA approach

# FUTURE INTEGRATION W/ GA:
--> We maintain a set of alpha values in the ACO and use them to calculate the "goodness" of an edge. We then use the ACO
    > to return discovered paths to the GA, which modifies the alpha values. The GA then returns new alpha values to the ACO.
    > The process is repeated in parallel until convergence.
