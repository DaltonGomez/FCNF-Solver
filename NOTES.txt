NOTES & TODOS:

GENERAL/NETWORK/SOLVERS:
=====================================
# TODO - Consider reformulating FlowNetwork as single super-source/single super-sink
>> % I'm wondering if this is essentially as it extends the alpha value to the sources and sinks when they are recast as edges
>> % On second thought, I don't think this matters as alpha values only remedy the fixed charge problem and src/sink are only variable charged
# TODO - Add to solution visualization a way to capture relative edge costs in color (or another meaning metric)
# TODO - Figure out how to enforce the one arc per edge constraint in the alpha-relaxed LP
>> % Do not worry about the single arc per edge constraint- it is implied if the capacity vs. cost function is convex
# TODO - Implement a Data-In class to read in an input graph from a csv (for example, SimCCS data)


ALPHA GENETIC ALGORITHM APPROACH:
=====================================
# TODO - Change pathing to be only pathlets and/or all paths
# TODO - Implement a nudge mutation, possibly Gaussian


ALPHA GENETIC ALGORITHM EXPERIMENTS:
=====================================
# TODO - Run tuning and results experiments
# TODO - Measure population diversity at genotypic and phenotypic levels
# TODO - Do sensitivity/perturbation analysis on alpha values

ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION APPROACH:
=====================================
# TODO - Revise ant behavior to avoid previously visited nodes altogether, rather than popping from the trip stack
>> Not actually a good idea as this will allow ants to get deadlocked at nodes surrounded by full capacity edges and previously visited nodes
# TODO - Revisit and test pheromone deposition and arc "goodness" equations
>> Should "goodness" equation be, G(e) = cap(e) / (FC(e) + VC(e) * cap(e)), as this would be flow/$ if the pipeline was at capacity.
# TODO - Determine if source/sink arcs should have special pheromone deposition and/or "goodness" of arc calculations
# TODO - Update behavior to preferentially select arcs with opposing flows as those are cost saving (in the post-processing)
# TODO - Revise the post-processing to cancel opposing flows so that it handles parallel arcs
# TODO - Adapt to account for parallel arcs (i.e. more than one possible edge capacity) and test on parallel edges
# TODO - Implement a termination criteria based on convergence, not just number of episodes/generations
# TODO - Run the ants in parallel
# TODO - Construct feasibility proof of the solution returned by an ant
# TODO - Attempt to prove the convergence of the colony's solution in the limit
# TODO - Consider adding some annealing schedules to hyperparameters to reset the amount of exploration


ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION EXPERIMENTS:
=====================================
# TODO - Clean up ant experiments to resemble the GA experiments
# TODO - Improve the hyperparameter tuning method and increase the search space
# TODO - Analyze time constraints


GA/ACO INTEGRATION:
=====================================
% Use the ants to determine paths/trim input graph and then use the GA to refine, potentially as an iterative process until convergence.


OTHER FUTURE IDEAS:
=====================================
% Use the dynamic nature of ACO for the optimal sink location within a feasible geologic region (i.e. polygon)
% Use the dynamic nature of ACO for the sink capacity uncertainty
