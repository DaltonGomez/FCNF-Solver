NOTES & TODOS:

GENERAL/NETWORK/SOLVERS:
=====================================
# TODO - Delete VERSION_1 directory after implementing GA package
# TODO - Add to solution visualization a way to capture relative edge costs in color (or another meaning metric)
# TODO - Revise method for assigning arc costs to better resemble SimCCS
% Do not worry about the single capacity per edge constraint- it is implied if the capacity vs. cost function is convex


ALPHA GENETIC ALGORITHM APPROACH:
=====================================
# TODO - Finish building out code base to match the level of VERSION_1
# TODO - Implement other probability functions for randomly initializing alpha values
# TODO - Change pathing to be only pathlets and/or all paths
# TODO - Implement a nudge mutation, possibly Gaussian
# TODO - Implement a termination criteria based on convergence, not just number of episodes/generations


ALPHA GENETIC ALGORITHM EXPERIMENTS:
=====================================
# TODO - Experiment with finding optimal alpha values from an exact MILP solution (i.e. reverse engineering)
# TODO - Build out accuracy and efficiency experiments
# TODO - Measure population diversity at genotypic and phenotypic levels
# TODO - Do sensitivity/perturbation analysis on alpha values
# TODO - Build a tuning experiment


ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION APPROACH:
=====================================
# TODO - Revise ant behavior to avoid previously visited nodes altogether, rather than popping from the trip stack
# TODO - Revisit and test pheromone deposition and arc "goodness equations"
# TODO - Determine if source/sink arcs should have special pheromone deposition and/or "goodness" of arc calculations
# TODO - Update behavior to preferentially select arcs with opposing flows as those are cost saving (in the post-processing)
# TODO - Revise the post-processing to cancel opposing flows so that it handles parallel arcs
# TODO - Adapt to account for parallel arcs (i.e. more than one possible edge capacity) and test on parallel edges


ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION EXPERIMENTS:
=====================================
# TODO - Improve the hyperparameter tuning method and increase the search space
# TODO - Clean up the way data is exported in the ant experiments


GA/ACO INTEGRATION:
=====================================
% Use the ants to determine paths/trim input graph and then use the GA to refine, potentially as an iterative process until convergence.


OTHER FUTURE IDEAS:
=====================================
% Use the dynamic nature of ACO for the optimal sink location within a feasible geologic region (i.e. polygon)
% Use the dynamic nature of ACO for the sink capacity uncertainty
